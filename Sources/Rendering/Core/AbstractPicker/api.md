## Introduction

define API for picking subclasses

vtkAbstractPicker is an abstract superclass that defines a minimal API for its concrete subclasses.
The minimum functionality of a picker is to return the x-y-z global coordinate position of a pick (the pick itself is defined in display coordinates).

The API to this class is to invoke the Pick() method with a selection point (in display coordinates - pixels)
and a renderer. Then get the resulting pick position in global coordinates with the GetPickPosition() method.
