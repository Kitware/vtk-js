 * These attributes are only used if the light is a positional light.
 * The default is a directional light (e.g. infinite point light source).
 * 
 * Lights have a type that describes how the light should move with respect
 * to the camera. A Headlight is always located at the current camera position
 * and shines on the camera’s focal point. A CameraLight also moves with
 * the camera, but may not be coincident to it. CameraLights are defined
 * in a normalized coordinate space where the camera is located at (0, 0, 1),
 * the camera is looking at (0, 0, 0), and up is (0, 1, 0). Finally, a
 * SceneLight is part of the scene itself and does not move with the camera.
 * (Renderers are responsible for moving the light based on its type.)
 * 
 * Lights have a transformation matrix that describes the space in which
 * they are positioned. A light’s world space position and focal point
 * are defined by their local position and focal point, transformed by
 * their transformation matrix (if it exists).
