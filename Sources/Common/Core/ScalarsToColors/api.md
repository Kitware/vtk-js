## vtkScalarsToColors - Superclass for mapping scalar values to colors

### Description

vtkScalarsToColors is a general-purpose base class for objects that
convert scalars to colors. This include vtkLookupTable classes and
color transfer functions. By itself, this class will simply rescale
the scalars.

The scalar-to-color mapping can be augmented with an additional
uniform alpha blend. This is used, for example, to blend a vtkActor's
opacity with the lookup table values.

Specific scalar values may be annotated with text strings that will
be included in color legends using SetAnnotations, SetAnnotation,
GetNumberOfAnnotatedValues, GetAnnotatedValue, GetAnnotation,
RemoveAnnotation, and ResetAnnotations.

This class also has a method for indicating that the set of
annotated values form a categorical color map; by setting
IndexedLookup to true, you indicate that the annotated values are
the only valid values for which entries in the color table should
be returned. In this mode, subclasses should then assign colors to
annotated values by taking the modulus of an annotated value's
index in the list of annotations with the number of colors in the
table.

## VectorComponent

If the mapper does not select which component of a vector
to map to colors, you can specify it here.

## VectorSize

When mapping vectors, consider only the number of components selected
by VectorSize to be part of the vector, and ignore any other
components. Set to -1 to map all components. If this is not set
to -1, then you can use SetVectorComponent to set which scalar
component will be the first component in the vector to be mapped.
