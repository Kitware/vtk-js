## Skybox Viewer

The Skybox Viewer allow to explore a surrounding environment based on one or many predefined locations which have been captured using 6 textures.
The skybox data format is bascially a zip file capturing all those locations with 6 images and some JSON metadata descriptions that perform the mapping between the image filenames and the target face of the skybox cube with possible image transformation (such as rotation and flip).

### Usage

The Skybox Viewer can be used as a link that encode both the Viewer path, the data URL, and some rendering configurations. The list below list every possible parameter that can be provided in the URL for tunning the user experience.

### VR Mode

- In VR mode, a `tap` can be used to move to the next position.
- On Android a `tap` will also trigger the fullscreen mode.
- For iOS devices, the landscape mode should switch to fullscreen on Safari; on Chrome and Firefox, that fullscreen mode is not available.
